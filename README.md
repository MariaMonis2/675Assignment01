**Task 01: Data Acquisition**

 We are required to retrieve the 200,000 posts by viewcount from the stack exchange website. The main issue while acquiring the dataset is that we can download only 50,000 records at a time. 
 select count(*) from posts where posts.ViewCount > 41423 â€“ this query returns 200,008 records

**Task 04: Calculate the per user TF-IDF through Hive**
